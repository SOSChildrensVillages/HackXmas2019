## About SOS Children's Villages
We are a global federation working to protect and care for children who have lost parental care, or who stand at risk of losing it.

- [Where we help](https://www.sos-childrensvillages.org/where-we-help) (in 136 countries around the world)

### About this Repo
[Our organization](https://www.sos-childrensvillages.org/organisation) is a federation of 118 national SOS Children's Villages associations. This Repo is maintained by developers from the umbrella organization: [SOS Children's Villages International](https://www.sos-childrensvillages.org/).
The Hackathon will be supported by people from our local SOS organization [SOS BÃ¸rnebyerne / SOS Children's Villages Denmark](https://www.sosbornebyerne.dk).

### What we have built so far internally
We have built and rolled out an [Angular](https://angular.io/) Application called PDB which stands for Programme Database. It is used by more than 6000 of our socialworkers in more than 100 countries and translated into 37 languages. It's used on Windows-PCs, Android Phones and Tablets.

We have added some offline-capabilites based on [service workers](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-getting-started) and indexed-db because some of our socialworkers work in places where the internet has not arrived yet.

The App supports our socialworker at her/his daily work. On field-trips (s)he would use it to assess the challenges a family is facing and make a plan how to support the family. Later the App should help the socialworker and the family to measure their progress and get the plan done.

Unfortunately we cannot publish the sourcecode of PDB in here, but that's how it looks like:

(You'll find more screenshots and pictures in /documentation/images)

And that's how it's used in a family's home:

## How you can help

Due to limited resources we had to focus on implementing the most needed business-requirements first. We had no time for "nice to have"-features that make the application more appealing to it's users.

We would appreciate your creative input in the form of
- Angular Components or WebComponents
    - a Component that looks like this: ![roadmapPrintout](./documentation/images/FamilyRoadmap-hand-coloured.jpg) so we can show a family's goals and progress to illiterate family-members.
    Every icon on the top represents a Goal from the "Family development plan" and the coloured "street" the precentage of done.
    - help us making our empty Cards on the Family-Screen less empty: ![screenshotFamilyScreen](./documentation/images/PDB-screenshot-FamilyOverview.png) How could we visualize a family? How could we dynamically render Avatars based on age, gender, personal issues?
    
- Come up with Creative inputs that make a Socialworkers life easier!
    - brainstorm and contribute wireframes or screenflows
    - contribute with prototypes (Angular, Typescript)
        - Think of maps where the families are located and scheduled tasks are due
        - reminders/toasts
        - a social-workers daily/upcoming tasks or field trips,...
    - which features should our Socialworkers have 2020?!
