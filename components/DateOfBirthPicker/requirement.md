Build a component that makes it very easy to select Birth-Dates of
Children, Youth and Adults.

We are not statisfied with any DatePicker we have seen so far.

It should work on PC, Tablet and Phone.
It should only show the relevant years (none in the future or too far in the past)

3-4 times touching with the finger should be enough.

We have users around the globe and they type dates in the strangest formats. Typing of text should therefore not be allowed, just pick by clicking options.
