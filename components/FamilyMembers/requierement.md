How can we make the Family-Card more appealing?!

A family might have 1 or 2 adults and many children.
Of all family-members we know gender, age and from 
the Core Assessment we even know if they are facing difficulties.
-> see icons in components/FamilyRoadmap/IconsForGoals
(see also the screenshots of Family development plan with the red/green icons for Health, Wellbeing, Education, Livelihood, Protection, Care)

Help us build an Avatar-Component that renders automatically based
on the given attributes.
(eg. maybe oder children are shown a bit taller,...)
